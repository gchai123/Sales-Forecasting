### Time Series Project Brief
This this a Time Series course project, our team worked on Sales Forecasting for  CorporaciÃ³n La Favorita. The data is downloaded from Kaggle, orginally include 4100 items data from 2013-2017.

We cut the datasize and only chose 2 stores, 5 families, 5 items for each family and store. In this way, it's easier to check our pipline and tune parameters.
